# rust

Compare with c++:
- Type system is not as expressive as C++.
- Borrow checker is not really that annoying tbh.
- Code interface (look and feel) is quite messy no matter how you write it.
- Way better designed. Way less quirks.
- Coherent documentation, everything is from the core team, so single source of truth.
- Don't even mention the build system.
- More feels like glorified C augmented with typeclass and closures.
