# Algol60

- Algol60 to c compiler: https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/algol-60-compiler
- John Reynold talking about programming and program proof in Algol 60! [The Craft of Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/jcr/ftp/craftprog.pdf)
- Algol60, apparently, came out from 1960s.
- Algol60 aimed to be a machine independent high level PL, in contrast of langaguages like cobal which tightly controlled by IBM.
- Algol60 is design by lots of turing award winners. Apparently John McCarthy, John Backus, Alan Perlis all involved in the design.
- Before Algol60 programming languages looked really different from what they are today. Given fortran, which didn't have many control structures at that time, and lisp, was still dynamic scoped.
- ALgol60 is well known for it's block structure which was inherited from Algo58.
- Algo60 was designed to advocate structure programming. The control flow of the program is expressed by statements, and the correctness of the program is proved by assertion logic.
- Algol60 was heavily influenced by lisp. Namely if statement and recursion. By the time recursion was still a new thing!
- Lot's of langauges are based on algo60 model, important ones like BCPL and simula.
- Algo60 has nested procedure and call by name...
- Old C also followed Algo60's parameter type declaration style, types of parameter goes before the starting left bracket.
- Thank god for bring lexical scoping.

Fortran, Lisp, Algol60, Cobal, all kinda came out at the same time. Fortran was 1957, lisp 1958, cobal 1959, and algol 60 1960. At the time there were no explicit paradigm, programming in assembly is still the mainstream approach of programming.
