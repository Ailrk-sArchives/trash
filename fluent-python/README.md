### Fluent python

You feel python is not a "easy to learn" language as they promoted if you really want to do things right.

There are so many things going on under the hood. If you just want to write some scripts that works you can ignore details for most of time, but a certified programmer need to know the language inside out. This book generally covered most core features of python in a great detail. But is not too deep that you can get to the implementation level. One feeling after reading it is that I don't feel the python's internal mechanisms mysterious anymore. It shows you how each sub topic fit into python as a whole system; and later even when you see a topic you have never seem before, you know where to learn more about it.
