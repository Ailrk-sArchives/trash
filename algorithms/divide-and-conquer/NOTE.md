### Divide and conquer

breaking things up into smaller problems.

Given a problem of size n divivde problem to n/b, b > 1.

ps: the smartness usually comes in combing small solutions.


### Runing time
T(n) = aT(n/b) + [work of merge]

### Master theorem
Something you can mechanically plug in and get solutions.
