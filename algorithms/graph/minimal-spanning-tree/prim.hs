module Prim where

-- prim algorithm is a greedy method to find the minial spanning tree in a graph.
-- That is, a connected unweighted acyclic graph that contains all vertices, and
-- edges being the subset of the original graph, while the sum of weights of edges
-- is minimum.
--
-- collapse vertexes
