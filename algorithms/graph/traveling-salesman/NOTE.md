#### Traveling salesman problem

Classical example of NP hard problem.

There are a series of "half" solutions for traveling salesman problem. We can't give the exact optimal solution in polynomial time, but we can get a good solution in reasonable amount of time.


#### Metric of TSP

1. d(x, y) >= 0
2. d(x, y) = d(y, x)
3. d(x, y) + d(y, z) >= d(x, z)
