# BFS and DFS

Although these are two super simple algorithms, it's very important to be super familiar with them because most of graph related algorithms are based on them. Strong familarity is also beneficial for gaining better insight of how other algorihtm works.

bfs and dfs use queue and stack to manage the frontier nodes. dfs use stack becasue it tries to frist traverse the child of child first. bfs insteand, tries to traverse nodes already added to the queue first.

The output of dfs and bfs and vary. it makes sense to output a traversal of the algorithm. Or if you are looking for a value then just return that value. Or maybe return a topological order or something. It's super flexible.

### Goal

Writing bfs and dfs should be like writing loop over lists.
