# Binary search

Although it's just binary search variations, it's very annoying to determine what boundary should be.

Most solutions ppl give are based on loop, which is really anti-intuitive way to formulate this types of recursive algorithms. At least I find it's hard for me to get all boundaries right in 10 minutes, so when in doubt I just write recursion.
