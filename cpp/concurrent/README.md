# Concurrent programming

## What's the matter
Statements like "CPU gets more cores, concurrency is the future, locks are so hard to write, blablabla" overly simplifies so many things and deliberately omitted context.

Concurrency is fundamentally a different model from naive turing mahcine or lambda calculus, as multiple things happen at the same time rather than in a seqential order, and you somehow want to have some control over the process.

We have many formailized models to describe computation. Turing machine, general recursive function, and lambda calculus. They are well kown for being equivalent to each other (The equivalcency is proved by encoding other models).

Besides this commonality, these three formalisms are all modeling sequential computation.
