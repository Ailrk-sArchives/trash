# Work through of the nix pill

At this point I almost feel nix expression should be the teaching language for functional programming. The core is so small but it got all the things you expect, and idioms to build up derivitives is such a good way to practise functional style patterns.

Maybe I will not switch to Nixos, but nix can be a good tool for managing haskell and c++ dependencies.
