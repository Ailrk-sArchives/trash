# Work through of the nix pill

nix expression should be the teaching language for functional programming! The language is so small but it got all the things you expect. Besides, it's idioms to build up derivitives is just a good very way for demonstrating functional pattterns.

Maybe I will not switch to Nixos, but it can be a good tool for managing haskell and c++ dependencies.
