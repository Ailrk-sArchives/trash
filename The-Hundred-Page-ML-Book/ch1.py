# What is machine learning? #
# Building algorithms rely on a collection of exmaples of some phenomenon.
# Solving problems by:
# 1. gathering dataset
# 2. algorithmatically building a statistical model based on that dataset.

# Types of learning #
# 1. Supervised learning, dataset {(xι, yι)}ι₌₁ᴺ
# 2. Unsupervised learning, dataset {xι}₌₁ᴺ
#       1. clutering
#       2. dimensionality reduction
#       3. outlier detection
# 3. Semi-supervised learning
# 4. Reinforcement learning
