# little schemer

One of the most famous book for sheme. I read it to prepare for sicp. It took me a while to finish just because I wasn't really familiar with programming really back then (even though I thought I was). For a cocky programming newbie topics in this book really opened my eye. At least by finishing this book you don't really think recursion is useless (how dare you..).
