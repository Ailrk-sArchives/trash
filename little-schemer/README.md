# little schemer

One of the most famous book for sheme. I read it to prepare for sicp. It took me a while to finish just because I wasn't really familiar with programming really back then (even though I thought I was). For a cocky programming newbie topics in this book really opened my eye. At least by finishing this book you don't really think recursion is useless (how dare you..).

One funny thing, I had some bad habbits afte read the book, there was a period I was writing python, and was trying to make it looks as scheme as possible, so I started to abuse iterator and recursion, like iterator of some iterators over a gnerator etc... And it leads to absolute diasters. it is a such a typical problem for me: you always try to flex some cool features just heard about. But eventually you learn over time that languages are generally desgiend with some principles, and if you forcibaly trying to turn a language to do things it is not designed to it is merely work out. So... don't trust your opinion after you just learn a new thing, cus there is 99 percent hype in it. Just keep learning different stuffs, and eventually when hypes are gone, those you still love are probably what really worthwhile.
