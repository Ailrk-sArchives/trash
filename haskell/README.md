# haskellwikibook

Most haskell practice. One problem of writing one of haskell code is the dependency. You need a cabal file to use external library, but most libraries you use are external.

I really wish one day bytestring, text, array, vector, containers, unordered-containers sequence, dlist, mtl, transformers, parsec, microlens, template haskell, gets into the prelude... oh gee that's too much.
