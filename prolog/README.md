## Prolog

#### Logic based computation
* base on relation
* asking if certain objects have some properties
* computation involves listing potential substituions and matching for the most appropriate one
* programming in a declarative style, focus on what is instead of how to
* other than given input computing the output, it can infer the input base on the output

###### sides
* uses swi-prolog. `swipl`
