# Books I read.

### 2020-04-29

Here is a little repository for some books examples and exercises I walked through.

I have some problems while reading books:

First is shallow understanding. You might've read a lot, but it is hard to verify if you really understand what you've read. When I'm reading, for most of the time I just scanning big words and made a rought picture. There is no in depth practice and discussions, which leads to a shaky fundation in knowledge. For instance, I was learning haskell and heard the word `monad`. I looked into some examples of implementations of different monads and known that there are some algebraic law a monad holds, all looks cool. But a week later, I ask myself: what are the monads algebraic laws? why you want your monad satisfy those properties? Guess what, I felt hard to anwser.

It is hard to reference what I learned quickly. You need to read a lot of book, each of them have some 500 pages. How can you quickly retrive information from what you have already read without jump into thousands and thousands of pages? I read about nodejs event loop structure in one book, and later heard about reactor model in another. Subconciously you feel they are the same thing, but how do you verify the connection? I need a way to old knowledge up on the table with the newer one to compare them.

I don't have a way to organize my knowledges. When you are writing a cheatsheet you might organize all topcis into a tree so you can quickly index the problem you are addressing. But when I am reading stuffs thing are rather atomic. You read today gc is good, tomorrow someone say gc cause disasters. So what specific problems are they addressig? What properties make certain task not suitable for gc language? To answer this question you need to strip down the properties of gc and find the one that is problematic. This mental map is very useful when learning stuffs you are not familiar with.

Of course, the last one is for my poor memory. Everyone complains they don't have good memory, but I am somewhat in another level. I don't even remember did I took shower today :p. It is pretty sad when you reailze you have read the entire book but can only recall 20% of the details. Need to find a more efficient way.

The best way of solving these problems might be have a friend or teacher constantly discuss with you. Talking through a topic force you to think about the content, rather than just passively getting the input. Besides that, things you discussed before is also easier to remember anyway. Unfortunately people have their own stuffs to do, and no one will be exactly in sync with what you are interested in. As an alternative, I found just rephrasing what you have read can achieve similar effect. If there is someting you can not explain concisely, you might want to spend more time on that. As opposite, If you can write a reasonably good summary, you probably can remember it several days later.

To make this process more systematic, examples and exercises from book are organized by its folder, every code here should have comments, and every book should have a README to recap. Code are not necessarily organized by chapter, so I have some freedom on how to structure them for different books. Some old codes is uncommented, I still need to work on that later. Hope this repo make things a little bit more organized.
