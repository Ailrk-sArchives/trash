# Simula

- Came out at 1962, more known version is the 1967 one: Simula 67.
- Made by Kristen Nygaard & Ole-Johan Dahl for simulations.
- It's garbage collected (oh.) StoupStrop mentioned how the gc was incredibly slow which made him want to make the memory management fully mannual to be performant.

- According to Stroustup Simula greatedly influenced C++ and it's class design.

- Simula is essentially a class augmented Algol60. Core semantics are bascially the same.

- Simula 67 cmes with lots of modern OOP elements.
  - class and objects
  - virtual procedure with dynamic dispatching
  - coroutines
  - inheritence + subtyping.
  - discrete-event simulation (DES) thingy. Apparently it's a simulation thingy of stochastic processes with discrete state. R seems to have it too.

- Simula has a wide influence on object oriented langauges. Started from C++, and to now many otheres that adopts the same model. Apparently James Gosling also influenced by it (make sense if he follows c++'s lead)

- The concept of record class was introduced by Hoare at 1966. Simula adopts the concepts and made some modification. Simula 67 comes only one year after this, must say they are pretty efficient.

- So many modern languages unify the conecpt of type and class, apparently it's a thing at this time already. There were a proposal to uify type and class but got rejected.
