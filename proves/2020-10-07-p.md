## -- Well ordering principle --
```
Nonempty set of positive integers have the smallest element.

## Proof  ‚àö2 is irrational with well ordering principle
#### Problem
```
‚àö2 is irrational with well ordering principle
```


#### Proof
```
Assume ‚àö2 is rational.
Thus ‚àÉ a, b ‚àà ‚Ñ§ s.t ‚àö2 = a/b .
Let S = { k‚àö2 | k ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Å∫, k‚àö2 ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Å∫ }.
We know S ‚â¢ ‚àÖ because a = b‚àö2 ‚àà S.

By well ordering principle, we have a smallest
element s = t‚àö2 ‚àà S where t ‚àà ‚Ñ§.

We have s‚àö2 - s = s‚àö2 - t‚àö2 = (s - t)‚àö2 = s(‚àö2 - 1)
{
    s, t ‚àà ‚Ñ§‚Å∫, s - t ‚àà ‚Ñ§,   ‚áí (s - t)‚àö2 ‚àà ‚Ñ§ ..(1),
    ‚àö2 > 1 ‚áí s(‚àö2 - 1) > 0  ‚áí (s - t)‚àö2 is positive ..(2)
} ‚áí (s -t)‚àö2 ‚àà S.

We also know ‚àö2 < 2 ‚áí ‚àö2 - 1 < 1 ‚áí s(‚àö2 - 1) < s ..(3)

So now we have an element (s -t)‚àö2 ‚àà S and smaller
then the smallest element s.

Contradiction.

Thus ‚àö2 must be rational.  ‚àé

#### PS
- It makes sense to construct set `S` to use well ordering theorem.
- If you can construct a set ‚àà ‚Ñ§, well ordering principle can be very useful to construct contradiction.
- After made the set `S`, the goal is to find an element smaller than the smallest element in `S`.
- How do they think of using `s‚àö2 - s` to construct an element smaller than s?
    - `s‚àö2 - s` shoule smaller than s anyway.
    - Elements in `S` should follow the rule.
    - But we have `s` is the smallest element, it's a sense of contradiction.


## Def: floor function
```
‚åäx‚åã is the largest integer ‚â§ x.
    ‚åäx‚åã ‚â§ x < ‚åäx‚åã + 1
```


## Proof: Every integer > 1 has a prime divisor.
#### Problem
```
Every integer > 1 has a prime divisor.
```


#### Proof by contradiction.
```
Assume ‚àÉ integer > 1 has no prime divisor.
Let S = { x | x ‚àà ùîπ, x > 1 }
By well ordering theorem, S has a smallest element n.

Because n has no prime divisor, n cannot be prime itself.
Thus write n = ab | a, b are composite numbers.

But because n is the smallest element in S, , a, b < n, so
a, b must have at least one prime divisor each.

Thus n has prime divisor.

Contradict.

So all integer > 1 has at least one prime divisor ‚àé
```


## PS
- Again use well ordering theorem to create contradiction.
- Here well ordering theorem cut ‚Ñ§‚Å∫ in half, contradiction happens at the lower half part.
