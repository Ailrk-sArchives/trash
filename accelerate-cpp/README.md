### acceleration c++

It is a really old book, and since c++ change so much it might not relevant anymore. C++ constantly add modern features, which might be the reason it's never obsolete. Only things I get from learning c++: it has so many corner cases and noise that It might be more efficient to learn a programming paradigm from another language first and then do c++, rather than learning programming through c++ all alone.
