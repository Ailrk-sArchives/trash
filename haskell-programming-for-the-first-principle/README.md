I really had a hard time when I first reading this book, but now look back this book actually only covers the very basics of Haskell. It is kinda like a theory bookbut not quite. It is like a theory book because it is too pure. A topic about a language feature will only be about the feature itself. For example I know what monad is, but what can I do with it? It didn't seems clear even after I read util monad transformer. Is not because I didn't understand monad by itself, it takes some imaginations to jump from a pure math algebraic structure to real world application I think. Learning haskell need a haskell mindset. Different from python or c++, in haskell you care much more about the math part of the language. Algebraic structures are actually playing essential roles in the language and is used all over the place in haskell programs.

I think the biggest role of this books is it introduced me some basic haskell lingos that I can refer to without being panic or too hyped about when reading other materials. It has awesome explaination about topic itself, but to better understand haskell as a programming language 'being used' it is better to read it with some googling. It's a very good book for beginner especially given most haskeller learn by reading paper...
